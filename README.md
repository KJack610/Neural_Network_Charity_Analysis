Neural Network Charity Analysis

Purpose of the Analysis: Create a neural network binary classify that would be to predict which applications would be successful and which applications would be unsuccessful if they were funded by Alphabet Soup.

Model Target: "Is Successful" is the target.

Model Features: Application_type, Affiliation, Classification, Use_case, Organization, Status, Income_amt, Special_considerations, Ask_amt

What variables should be removed?: EIN and NAME were removed 

How many neurons, layers and activation functions did you select? To optimize the model, the first layer included 50 neurons, the 2nd included 40 neurons and 3rd layer included 30 nueurons. These were selected as an effort to find the optimal weight.

Additional and hidden layers were also added

Target Model Performance: The model reached .7243. It didnt reach the target performance

Steps taken to increase model performance:
a. hidden lyaers increased and neurons per layer increased
b. utilization of different activaition fuctions.
c. Increase number of epochs.

Summary:
Despite changes made for model optimization, the model did not meet the performance expectaitons. 

Recommendation:
Use deep learning model with increased data in training se.
